- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

There were 124,824 non-member reviews and 480 member reviews.


- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

The study found that there were 214 five-star reviews by Vine members, and 71,737 by non-members


- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

Vine members have 5 stars rate of 44.58
Non-Vine members have 5 stars rate of 57.47%




## Summary

The outcome did not show bias in Vine reviews.In fact, Vine members are less inclined to promote 5-stars products. 

I would create an analyze of 4-star products reviews, using the same method to give more precise bias test. 
With bigger data set, it might offer a different perspective of member bias.
